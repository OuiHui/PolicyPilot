1. Defining the Problem and Opportunity
Health-insurance denials are widespread in the U.S. marketplace. Nearly 19% of in-network claims are denied, yet less than 0.1%  are appealed. Although 60% of appeals succeed, patients rarely take on the process. This is because denial notices are confusing, deadlines are strict (days for urgent care, weeks for routine claims), and the burden of proof is placed on individuals. Additionally, lower-income households and those with limited English proficiency are disproportionately harmed. As insurers increasingly automate decisions, the imbalance of power grows, creating an opportunity for a consumer-centric solution that demystifies the process and empowers more people to pursue justice.
Appeals landscape
In the lifecycle of a claim, a denial is generally classified as either a case correction or a formal appeal.
Common denial reasons: medical necessity, lack of prior authorization, out-of-network services, administrative errors, benefit limits, and coverage termination.
Typical process: Patients must review denial notices, identify the reason, correct any errors with the insurer’s claims adjuster (case correction), collect supporting medical records and physician letters, and may submit a formal appeal. However, meeting deadlines, assembling evidence, and keeping up with insurance correspondence is burdensome and fragmented.
Ideal customers and stakeholders
Middle-class adults in their thirties and sixties, known as the “sandwich generation”, are the primary market. These individuals juggle care for their children, parents, and themselves, facing frequent medical expenses. They earn roughly $50-100K annually, making them sensitive to the financial strain of denied claims. Beyond the patient, other stakeholders include insurers (who control decisions), providers (who supply documentation), and regulators (who enforce fair practices).
2. Research and User Insights
Customer discovery approach
We designed an outreach plan to understand how patients and caregivers experience denials. We connected with participants through caregiver-focused Facebook groups, personal referrals from healthcare contacts, and LinkedIn searches for industry experts. Interviews were supplemented by surveys and follow-up questionnaires to quantify the frequency of pain points.
What we learned
Knowledge gap: The majority of interviewees never attempted to appeal because they couldn’t locate/understand their policy documents or didn’t know appeals were an option. Those who succeeded had specific knowledge of their rights that most lack.
Need for empathy and control: Participants rejected the idea of a fully automated solution that would further reduce their agency. Even tech-savvy users wanted to review and approve each step with simplified explanations. They also preferred an empathetic tone, acknowledging the emotional toll of dealing with a denial.
Time burden and procedural frustration: Caregivers who are balancing jobs, family care, and medical crises felt overwhelmed by the administrative steps. Since over 50% of recoverable denials are case corrections, correspondence with insurers was identified as the biggest time sink.
3. Product Concept: PolicyPilot
Customer insights drove the definition of PolicyPilot, an agentic AI platform that pairs legal knowledge with user control. The concept focuses on three core barriers: inability to understand policy documents, reluctance to trust opaque automation, and excessive focus on formal appeals when many issues can be corrected quickly.
Key capabilities (not updated)
Secure policy onboarding: Users upload their denial letters, medical bills, and either a comprehensive policy document or multiple supplementary documents. To be HIPAA compliant, all personal identifiers will be stripped before feeding it to our local LLM. Then the system extracts insurer name, policy number, and denial reason, and indexes coverage provisions. This step ensures later recommendations are grounded in actual policy text.
Collaborative strategy analysis: By describing the denied service in plain language, users receive a strategy analysis that determines whether a simple claim correction or a formal appeal is appropriate. For the MVP scope, only the claims correction strategy will be implemented. The system surfaces the policy sections that conflict with the denial letter and generates a professional email draft with a clear subject line and contact information. Rather than producing a final output, it displays the rationale, allows editing, and requires user approval before any communication is sent.
Email automation and response handling:  Once a user approves an outreach, PolicyPilot sends the message from the user’s email account, monitors the inbox for replies, explains the adjuster’s arguments, and prepares context-aware follow-up drafts. This feature relieves users of the back-and-forth administrative burden while keeping them in the loop through approvals and summaries.
Value proposition
By translating complex insurance language into actionable insights, PolicyPilot educates users about their rights. It operates as an educational partner rather than a black box: users remain in control of decisions, but gain the efficiency of AI assistance. Focusing on claim corrections first increases the chance of early success and builds trust. The platform’s focus on empathy, transparency, and user agency positions it as an empowering tool for overwhelmed patients.
4. Design Rationale and Prototype (unupdated)
The initial design pitch emphasized a straightforward user flow: log in, upload documents, receive a strategy analysis and manage correspondence. The design prioritizes trust through clear privacy controls (OAuth for secure account linking and stripping personal identifiers for HIPAA compliance), empathy by acknowledging the comprehensive policy document is hard to find (optional submission of supplemental documents), and educational aids (technical terms highlighted with plain-language explanations). Because over half of the denials in our research were resolved through corrections, the interface centers on drafting concise, evidence-based emails rather than complex appeal forms.

To build trust, each action includes an approval step, allowing users to edit content before sending. The tone of the interface intentionally conveys empathy (acknowledging frustration and delays) rather than presenting cold, automated responses. While future versions may include automated retrieval of policy documents or full appeal submissions, the MVP focuses on high-impact features that can be developed quickly and validated with real users.
User stories summary (unupdated)
Document upload: Users must be able to upload PDFs or images of denial letters and policy documents securely. The system should parse them to identify denial reasons.
Plain-language explanations: After parsing, users need clear explanations of why their claim was denied, learn their rights, and whether a correction or formal appeal is recommended.
Drafted correspondence: The tool should draft outreach emails citing relevant policy sections. Users can edit and must approve the draft.
Inbox monitoring: Once approved, the system sends the email from the user’s account, monitors for replies and provides context-aware draft responses, again seeking user approval.

These user stories drive the prototype’s architecture and ensure that each feature can be tested against specific acceptance criteria.

5. Planned Technical Architecture (unupdated)
The PolicyPilot system will be organized around a hybrid storage and AI pipeline. It will use PostgreSQL for user accounts, case metadata, and email logs, and a separate vector database to store embeddings of de‑identified document chunks to support retrieval‑augmented generation. Uploaded denial letters and policy documents will be passed through an OCR and personal-health-information‑removal pipeline that strips all 18 identifiers mandated by HIPAA. The cleaned text is chunked and embedded. These vectors are linked to the original documents via a relational key. When a user requests help, the backend conducts a hybrid text-vector search to retrieve relevant policy passages. A routing layer then selects between an on‑premise model (for routine analysis) and a cloud LLM (for complex email drafting and explanations) to generate structured JSON containing strategy recommendations, highlighted terms and an editable email draft. The frontend consumes this JSON to dynamically render highlighted documents and editing components, while OAuth‑integrated email services send and monitor correspondence through an MCP proxy server.
