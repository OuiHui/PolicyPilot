​​Executive Summary​ 

Health insurance denials are an obstacle to receiving healthcare in the United States, with ACA marketplace plans denying nearly one-in-five claims and consumers appealing less than 0.1% of those denials (Pollitz et al., 2023). Current research highlights how confusing processes and limited advocacy resources dissuade most consumers in their efforts to appeal. This problem scales as insurers increasingly use AI-driven algorithms to review claims, often issuing questionable insurance denials that are overturned more than 90% of the time when challenged (Mello & Rose, 2024). These dynamics create a clear opportunity: a consumer-facing AI solution that can automate and simplify appeals in an effort to combat insurance companies from taking advantage of patients at a moment of growing need. 

​​​​​​Problem Definition​​​​​ 

Currently in America, patients in the healthcare system face an imbalance of power when challenging health insurance denials. The low rate of appeals is not the result of patients agreeing with insurers’ decisions, but rather the fact that the appeals system is designed in ways that are confusing and difficult for most consumers to navigate (Pollitz et al., 2023). The people most affected are those with the least resources, such as lower-income households and immigrant households with limited English literacy, since they have the lower likelihood of successfully appealing without external aid (Horný et al., 2025).  The problem is worsening as insurers increasingly rely on artificial intelligence and algorithmic tools to process claims. Investigations into Medicare Advantage have shown that algorithm-driven denials often cut care prematurely, with more than 90% of denial appeals being overturned upon review (Mello & Rose, 2024). Denied healthcare claims result in delayed care, financial strain, and inequitable health outcomes. Patients neeing urgent treatment are forced to postpone care, risk, worsening conditions, or pay out-of-pocket. 

​​​Customer Insights 

​​​​​Research reveals how patients are trapped in a system designed to overwhelm them.​​​​ Out of the 17% of in-network claims denied by Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, only 0.1% of those denials are appealed by consumers (Pollitz et al., 2023). Recently, health insurance company Cigna was sued for allegedly denying 300,000 health insurance claims using artificial intelligence to avoid manually reviewing claims; only 0.2% of the denied claims were appealed (Schreiber, 2025). This gap between the number of denials issued and appeals pursued indicates that systemic obstacles prevent consumers from challenging unfair insurance decisions. The appeals process remains confusing and inaccessible because most individuals lack institutional knowledge of health policies.  

Market Context 

The broader market for the agentic AI app is insured consumers facing financial pressure due to claim denials who would appeal if they had the resources and knowledge to do so.  The main existing options are nonprofit advocacy groups like Patient Advocate Foundation that offer free case managers (Patient Advocate Foundation, 2023b). However, they serve hundreds of thousands of patients with only a couple hundred staff members (Patient Advocate Foundation, 2021). Thus, customers must wait months to see results (Patient Advocate Foundation, 2023a). While the consumer side remains overlooked, there is growing competition in AI-powered denial management software solutions for providers, including companies like Aspirion, Cofactor AI, Elion Health, and H2O.ai (Towards Healthcare, 2024).  

De-Risking the Hypothesis 

The main hypothesis is that an AI-powered agent can help streamline the insurance appeals process by reducing consumer confusion and mitigating inequities in healthcare access. To validate this, we propose testing whether AI can reliably synthesize claim documents by analyzing successful appeal patterns for common denial types. Demonstrating that this logic is replicable would establish feasibility. Ultimately, we assume that the appeals generated by AI have a higher success rate than manually written appeals by patients. To test our assumption, our team can conduct a small pilot with a clinic using the tool to create appeals for actual denied claims and track the approval rate of those previously denied claims. If the AI-generated appeals outperform typical patient-written appeals, this would prove adequate validation for the AI tool. 

Opportunity Framing 

The market has potential to grow as a result of the increase in insurance claim denials. As noted earlier, health insurance companies such as Cigna used artificial intelligence to mass-deny 300,000 claims within the span of 2 months (Schreiber, 2025). Simultaneously, the healthcare industry is digitalizing: ​​​​78​​​​% of physician offices and 96% of non-federal hospitals in the United States having implemented electronic health records systems (Towards Healthcare, 2024), and UnitedHealthcare has now required electronic submissions for Medicaid claims in certain states (United Healthcare, 2025). These trends create the perfect opportunity for an agentic AI appeals platform.
