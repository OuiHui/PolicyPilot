PolicyPilot is an agentic AI platform that automates the complex and frustrating health insurance appeal process. Thus, our baseline customer must be an insured individual. However, not all insured individuals need PolicyPilot. They must be insured and facing financial or timely pressure due to claim denials. Demographically, these are people who are in their 40s and 50s. Middle aged adults face more frequent health issues themselves, for their children, and for their aging parents, so they are commonly referred to as the “sandwich generation” (Ultimate Care, 2025). Unfortunately, this means they are at greater risk of inaccurate claim denials due to the higher frequency and complexity of medical needs. Senior adults are also at high risk of health denials. According to a recent US Senate investigation, UnitedHealth has been increasingly denying care for older patients who seek aftercare for conditions like strokes, falls, and injuries. From 2019 to 2022, the denial rate jumped from 1.4% to 12.6%, resulting in over 34,000 denied claims (Joseph, 2025). In addition to age, the ideal customer is in the middle-class segment with a household income of $50,000 to $100,000 annually, because they are the most vulnerable to the financial strain of denied claims. Psychologically, our ideal customer feels the appeals process is time-consuming and confusing and might even view insurance companies as profit-driven entities that prioritize profits over patient needs (Joseph, 2025). 

Therefore, the ideal initial focus for our startup is the middle class “sandwich generation”. They are ideal because they demonstrate a clear need and strong motivation. As previously mentioned, their frequent medical/caretaking needs make them a high risk group for claim denials. Because our agentic AI platform offers a solution to this problem, we have immediate value. Furthermore, this group is uniquely motivated to adopt a solution like PolicyPilot. Even though they are intelligent and capable of navigating the appeal process, they lack the leisure to spend hours drafting an appeal. They are still emotionally invested but lack the tools to fight back effectively. For example, people are reluctant to hire legal experts due to high costs and a perception of inefficiency (Bottorff, 2023), leaving families frustrated and underserved. By focusing on this group first, our startup can rapidly validate product-market fit since these users are motivated to seek streamlined solutions. With a solution powered by agentic AI, our startup provides a tool that simplifies the appeals process so that it is accessible to any individual even if they are not tech savvy, and this alignment of high need and clear value capture of increased appealed rates will accelerate early adoption and growth of our startup. 

The main stakeholders in the health insurance appeals process are the patient, the insurer, the healthcare provider, and regulatory bodies. Patients seek to overturn denials to avoid financial hardship and access necessary care, though their influence is limited without strong, evidence-based appeals. Insurers hold the most direct influence over appeal outcomes; they act as gatekeepers that are motivated by financial risk management and compliance. Providers (doctors, billing offices, etc.) want timely payment and reduced administrative burden. They control the clinical documentation and correct claims that can prove medical necessity. Regulators (state insurance commissioners and federal agencies) enforce laws, protect consumers, and ensure fair practices. While not involved in individual cases, they hold ultimate authority since the threat of enforcement compels insurer compliance.  

Our mission is to empower patients who have been unjustly denied health insurance claims by giving them access to expert-level appeal advocacy through AI. Our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is the overwhelmed patient, and our solution transforms their frustration into strong, evidence-based appeals. Success depends on addressing the broader ecosystem: crafting appeals in insurers’ language, partnering specifically with providers to simplify documentation access, and enabling employers to improve employee satisfaction while reducing HR burden. 

 	The opportunity lies in the inefficiency of the current system, where insurers rely on patients giving up. By automating persistent, high-quality appeals, we create value for all stakeholders—patients get care, providers get paid, employers see happier employees, and insurers are held accountable—ultimately building a fairer and more efficient system.

 Customer Discovery Plan: 

Connection Strategy  

Our customer discovery strategy will mainly focus on reaching both patients and caregivers who are directly impacted by claim denials and industry stakeholders who work within the appeals process professionally. Industry stakeholders include healthcare providers who deal with medical records requests, patient advocates who support families through denials, insurance professionals who understand how decisions are made, and more. By engaging with these groups, we can capture the personal burden of denials and better understand the systemic challenges that shape the appeals process. We will pursue the following methods: 

Online communities: First, we will work to be active in Facebook groups for caregivers and the older generation. By searching for keywords including “claim denied” or “appeal”, we will be able to find groups discussing their struggles and invite them to share their experiences through an interview. We can also join groups such as “Elder Care Support” or any disease-specific groups to find more individuals currently living through this problem or wanting change.  

Personal Referrals: Also, we can use personal networks, starting with people around us like Jennifer’s dad for insurance expertise and Reza for information on healthcare IT. We can ask for their perspectives as experts in their field and use this connection to introduce us to others who may have faced similar challenges or have deeper knowledge on certain topics. This will create a referral snowball effect that will provide our team with more professional insight and diverse perspectives. 

Industry Expertise: We will use LinkedIn to search for profiles with keywords such as healthcare admin or patient advocate to craft a personalized cold outreach message. There are professionals who see denial patterns daily and can provide system-level insights into any bottlenecks that we couldn’t see coming. We can also use LinkedIn to reach out to local chapters of organizations like the Patient Advocate Foundation and approach our target audience in the form of furthering research. 

Provider Partnerships: We will build partnerships with any patient advocates and billing managers working at local clinics and hospitals since these professionals are on the front lines of the appeals process. These individuals see how patients struggle with denial claims firsthand and can help provide detailed insights into documentation requirements and procedural obstacles that make the appeals process so difficult. Also, with patient consent, these professionals may be able to connect us to individuals at their clinic or hospital that are currently experiencing struggles from denials and want to share their experiences. This would strengthen our discovery process and also build an early foundation for PolicyPilot with denial data so that we can test our solutions in a real-world healthcare setting. 

Data Collection Methods  

To gather feedback, as mentioned previously, we will engage with caregiver groups on Facebook. Facebook is ideal for reaching our target of ages 40 and up because they are highly engaged with the platform. Our engagement plan consists of two surveys and a round of interviews.  First, we will post a pre-screening survey to identify potential interview candidates with significant experience in health insurance claim denials. This ensures that those selected for interviews can provide deep insights into their pain points. Then we will proceed with 30-minute interviews that will explore their stories, frustrations, and motivations in case the survey did not capture certain unstated needs. We need to hear anecdotes like Prof. Jennifer's story about her blood clot denial to truly grasp the pain points. Afterwards, we will send out a validation survey. This survey will ask questions about the problems we heard in the interviews. Thus, we can validate that these problems are widespread and quantify their significance. Since the “sandwich” generation often has limited time due to balancing care for children, parents, and themselves, surveys provide a more convenient way for many to participate. Therefore, this data collection plan will help us understand not only the emotional journey of our users but also gather data to validate the scale of the problem.

Interviews: 

24 year old male covered under his father’s plan 

Interviewee Profile: 

Age: 24 

Insurance Company: Cigna 

Manages healthcare for: Self and parents 

Appeal filed for: Self 

Medical Service Denied: Blood work (screening test) 

Claim Amount: $300 

Provider Type: In-network 

Appeal Type: Internal review 

Outcome: Successful (Cigna eventually covered the cost) 

Time to Resolution: ~1 month 

Interview Questions & Key Responses 

1. Can you describe the context of the denial? 

Had a blood test that was previously covered, but this time was charged $300. 

Insurance is through a union plan (father’s plan), which complicated communication because Cigna kept redirecting to the union representative (“Teenster”). 

Felt there were “a lot of extra steps” because he is not the primary policyholder. 

2. How did you find out about the denial and what was your reaction? 

Received an email from the primary care physician stating insurance did not cover the service and payment was due. 

Initial reaction: Frustrated that insurance didn’t cover a service that was previously covered. 

3. What was the stated reason for denial? Was it clear? 

Most confusing part was determining who the primary insurance was. 

System showed him as uninsured, but Cigna said he was insured. Union representative (Teenster) said he was not insured. 

Confusion stemmed from being on a union plan without being a union member. 

4. How confident were you in challenging the denial? 

Before sending appeal: Unsure if he was contacting the right person. 

After sending appeal: Confident because his argument was clear (coverage should continue under parents’ plan until age 26). 

Process involved multiple calls and emails, with slow responses. 

5. How difficult was it to gather documentation? 

Had to request doctor’s notes proving the exam was performed. 

Took one week to receive documentation, another week for Cigna to respond. 

6. What was the most frustrating part of the process? 

“Understanding who you needed to talk to.” 

Felt the communication chain (Cigna → Union → Provider) was inefficient and confusing. 

7. What would you change about the appeals process? 

Improve website accessibility to clarify union vs. non-union member pathways. 

8. Have you used AI before? Do you trust it for important tasks? 

High exposure to AI (ChatGPT, Grok for school). 

Trusts AI for efficiency and personalized responses. 

9. Would you use an AI app to automate the appeals process? 

No. Main barriers: 

Privacy concerns with connecting insurance and hospital accounts. 

Wants human empathy—e.g., “So sorry you had to go through this, I have resolved it for you.” 

Analysis of Interview Insights 

1. Problems, Needs, or Motivations Uncovered 

Confusion in Communication Pathways: The interviewee was frustrated by not knowing whom to contact due to a union-based plan structure. This reflects a systemic gap in clarity for dependent policyholders. 

Administrative Burden: Even a small claim ($300) required significant effort—gathering documents, waiting for responses, and navigating multiple parties. 

Desire for Empathy and Reassurance: Despite being tech-savvy and trusting AI for efficiency, the interviewee still values human-like empathy in stressful situations like insurance appeals. 

Need for Clarity and Guidance: The appeal succeeded only because the interviewee understood his rights (coverage until 26). Many may lack this knowledge, leading to abandoned appeals. 

2. Evidence/Examples from the Interview 

Quote on Confusion: 
“The most confusing part was who their primary insurance was… felt like a lot of extra steps.” 

Pattern of Delay: 
Documentation took one week, Cigna’s response took another week, total resolution time was one month. 

Story of Success Through Persistence: 
He succeeded only because he knew to argue based on age-dependent coverage—a detail many may not know or pursue. 

Barrier to AI Adoption: 
“No, privacy issue. Also want human empathy… want to see the product say: ‘So sorry you had to go through this.’” 

3. Implications for the Problem and Opportunity 

Problem Validation: 
This case supports the hypothesis that the appeals process is confusing and time-consuming—even for a young, tech-literate person. The low appeal rate cited in the case study (0.1%) is understandable given these friction points. 

ICP Alignment & Divergence: 
The interviewee is 24, which is younger than the ICP’s “sandwich generation” (40s–50s). However, his experience managing his and his parents’ healthcare hints at early “sandwich generation” responsibilities. This suggests a broader market may include younger adults assisting family members. 

Opportunity Refinement: 

An AI tool must simplify communication routing (e.g., identifying correct contacts based on plan type). 

Privacy and empathy are critical barriers—not just functionality. The AI must balance automation with compassionate communication. 

Success stories like this show that clear, rule-based arguments (e.g., “coverage until 26”) win appeals—AI can excel here by leveraging plan documents and successful appeal templates. 

Interviewee: 39, Female 

Insurance Context: Employer-sponsored plan through United Healthcare. 

Situation: ER visit for potential blood clot (a Level 4 emergency) after a referral from urgent care. 

1. Can you describe the situation that led to the insurance denial? 

Jen experienced leg swelling after multiple international flights and was referred to the ER by urgent care due to concerns about a blood clot, a Level 4 emergency on United Healthcare's scale. 

Despite the high emergency rating, United Healthcare denied full coverage for the ER visit. 

A second, related issue involved the "contracted rate": Jen was billed more for a service than the hospital's listed price because the insurer's negotiated rate was higher. Appealing this was futile as the "contracted rate supersedes" everything. 

2. What was your reaction to the denial and the overall financial impact? 

Frustration & Feeling Betrayed: The primary feeling was frustration at having "no choice" but to go to the ER, following all correct medical protocols, only to be denied. The reasoning felt "confusing" and like a "loophole" (e.g., "oh, well, you didn't have a blood clot, so..."). 

Financial Burden: The out-of-pocket cost was approximately $3,000. While Jen could afford it, it was a significant "unexpected cost" that forced trade-offs. 

Powerlessness: She discovered through her own research that United had a known pattern of denying Level 4 claims, making the appeal feel predetermined. She ultimately dropped the appeal because the cost of escalating (e.g., lawyers) would have exceeded the potential savings. 

3. What was the process of gathering documents and understanding the bills like? 

Document Chaos: The process was fragmented. She received an Explanation of Benefits (EOB), an actual bill, and multiple bills from different units and doctors involved in the single ER visit. It took "a while to fully understand what I was actually being billed." 

Lucky Advantage: Jen had two significant advantages most consumers lack: 

Industry Knowledge: Previous work at a medical clinic that handled off-label drug appeals gave her the mindset to "not just take health insurance and the bills at face value." 

Personal Resource: Her father works in insurance (though not health insurance) and could provide guidance on what was appealable. 

4. Why do you think most people don't appeal denials? 

Knowledge Gap: The core problem is "people don't know what they don't know." There's a inherent trust that the system is designed to work for them. "You pay all this money for it, so you assume that when you go, it's gonna work properly." 

Assumption of Futility: Many assume the initial denial is the final word and are unaware of the multi-level appeals process or the strict deadlines that govern it. 

Overwhelm: The process is overwhelming, especially when dealing with a serious health issue and a large bill. The complexity of the documents (medical coding, insurance terminology) is a significant barrier. 

5. What about the appeals process deadlines? 

Jen confirmed deadlines are a critical and complicated factor. They vary widely (24 hours to 90 days) based on: 

The stage of the appeal (internal vs. regulatory). 

State vs. federal laws (which can supersede each other). 

She highlighted a key insight: if the insurance company or a government agency misses its deadline to respond, the claim might automatically be approved. However, this is a "loophole" very few consumers know to track or enforce. 

6. What is the one thing you would change? 

Transparency: Jen emphasized the need for transparency in billing and policy language. 

Demystification: The operational and billing side of healthcare uses a "language that your average person doesn't understand." Any solution must break down this complexity and clearly outline a patient's options. 

7. What are your thoughts on using an AI solution for this? 

Comfort with AI: As a tech professional, Jen is highly comfortable with AI but is also more aware of its limitations and risks than the average consumer. 

Conditional Trust: She would use an AI appeals app, but with strong "guardrails." Her primary concerns are: 

Security & Compliance: HIPAA compliance, data privacy, and cybersecurity are non-negotiable. 

Human-in-the-Loop: The ability to review and approve any action before it's submitted is essential. She does not trust AI to operate fully autonomously on such critical matters. 

Analysis & Strategic Summary 

1. Problems, Needs, and Motivations Uncovered 

Problem 1: The Asymmetric Power Dynamic. Patients feel powerless against a system designed with complex, opaque rules. They follow medical advice (e.g., going to the ER) in good faith, only to be financially penalized by loopholes and confusing policy interpretations. The motivation is for empowerment and fairness. 

Problem 2: Overwhelming Administrative Complexity. The appeals process is a labyrinth of chaotic documents (EOBs, multiple bills), tight and varying deadlines, and specialized knowledge. The need is for a simplifier and an organizer that reduces cognitive load. 

Problem 3: The "Math Problem" of Appeals. Consumers perform a cost-benefit analysis where the time, stress, and potential cost of fighting a denial often outweigh the financial burden of just paying it. This is especially true if they lack confidence. The need is for a solution that lowers the barrier to entry—making appeals fast, cheap, and less stressful. 

Problem 4: Critical Knowledge Gaps. Most people are unaware that appeals are possible, that deadlines are critical, and that insurers can be held accountable for their own procedural delays. The need is for education and advocacy, translating insurance jargon into actionable insights. 

2. Evidence from the Interview 

Asymmetric Power: "It felt very much like... they were finding weird loopholes... So you feel almost betrayed by these people who are supposed to help you." Her research revealing United's "known" pattern of denying Level 4 claims confirms the systemic nature of the problem. 

Administrative Complexity: "You get an Explanation of Benefits, which is this giant thick document. And then you get the actual bill... I got bills from different units and different doctors." This vividly illustrates the document chaos. 

The "Math Problem": "It didn't make sense to go through a more intense appeal process and involve lawyers because I would have spent more." This is a pure, rational economic decision that leads to a suboptimal outcome for the consumer. 

Knowledge Gaps: "Most people get the bill and they just take it at face value... people just don't know what they don't know." Jen’s contrast between her post-clinic-work mindset and her previous self is a powerful story of how knowledge changes behavior. 

3. Implications for the Problem and Opportunity 

Validation of Core Hypothesis: This interview strongly validates the startup's premise. Jen's experience is a textbook case of the time-consuming, confusing, and unfair process we aim to solve. Her story of dropping the appeal due to cost/effort is the exact behavior we want to change. 

Shift from "Convenience" to "Necessity": The insight isn't just that the process is inconvenient; it's that it's functionally impossible for the average person to navigate successfully without specialized knowledge or significant personal resources. This elevates our solution from a nice-to-have tool to a necessary advocate. 

Product Feature Implications: 

Deadline Tracking is a Killer Feature: Jen’s mention of the "auto-approval" loophole for missed insurer deadlines is a golden insight. Building a robust, state-specific deadline tracker and automated follow-up could be a primary source of user wins and value demonstration. 

Document Aggregation & Simplification is Core: The product must excel at ingesting EOBs, medical bills, and plan documents and presenting a unified, simple summary. This directly attacks the overwhelm. 

The "Human-in-the-Loop" is Mandatory: Jen's perspective as a tech-savvy user confirms that full autonomy is a non-starter for trust. The AI should be an agentic assistant, not an autonomous agent. Features like "Review Before Sending" and clear explanations of its reasoning are critical for adoption. 

Marketing & Messaging Implications: 

Frame the product as an "Advocate" and "Educator." Don't just say "we file appeals." Say "we uncover the loopholes they don't want you to know about" and "we translate the fine print into your winning strategy." 

Target "Post-Denial Desperation": As seen in Jen's clinic example (and common in cancer cases), the most acute need arises when a denial threatens both health and financial ruin. Marketing should speak directly to this high-stakes emotional state. 

Build Trust through Security Transparency: Security, privacy, and HIPAA compliance cannot be buried in a terms of service. They must be front-and-center in our messaging to overcome the inherent skepticism about handing over sensitive medical and financial data to an AI. 

This interview doesn't just confirm the problem—it provides a blueprint for the solution: a powerful, transparent, and guided AI advocate that demystifies the process and restores power to the patient. 

Participant: 63-year-old child of an elderly parent with Alzheimer's. Manages his own and his mother's healthcare. Worked in insurance. 
Insurance Company Involved: UnitedHealthcare 
Context: Appeal for mother's hospitalization due to A-fib (Atrial Fibrillation). 

1. What was the context and value of the appeal? 

Service: Hospitalization for A-fib, with denial of certain specific procedures. 

Initial Denied Amount: Approximately $18,000. 

Final Amount Paid: ~$280 after successful internal appeal. 

2. What was the appeals process like? 

Type: In-network, bill dispute, internal/reconsideration appeal with UnitedHealthcare. 

Process Trigger: Discovered the denial via a high bill from the hospital, not a formal denial letter from the insurer. 

Action Taken: 

First, requested an itemized bill from the hospital. This alone reduced the bill from $18,000 to $8,000 because the hospital had "added stuff that shouldn't have been added." 

Then, contacted UnitedHealthcare claims adjuster by phone to question the denials. 

Submitted a written appeal: No specific form was required. Simply sent a list of precise questions about each uncovered procedure.  

Provided insight that if a specific form is required, the usual basic info is: name, claim number, 2-3 months of justification. 

Documentation: Only needed the updated itemized bill from the hospital, which was obtained via email after some difficulty, and the list fo questions. 

Deadline: Was not given a formal deadline but acted within 2 days due to personal urgency. 

3. What were the key challenges and frustrations? 

Biggest Frustration: The time-consuming nature and being treated as a "number." 

Quote: "The biggest complaint: time. Hospitals and doctors want their money, insurance ensures they are legally liable before willing to pay... They are not in a hurry. You become a number, you get to where you are in the pile. The consumer wants things finalized as soon as possible." 

Primary Hurdle: Dealing with the hospital to get a correct, itemized bill was more difficult than dealing with the insurance company for the appeal itself. 

Emotional State: Feels the system is designed to delay and depersonalize. Expressed that most consumers "hate insurance" and see it as a necessary evil (hate paying for it and hope won’t have to use insurance). 

4. What is the participant's perception of the broader system? 

On Appeals: Believes most people don't appeal because they find the process daunting. Sees value in a product that can write his list of questions clearly. 

Personally didn’t know many people who have appealed for health insurance because he believes that big commercial insurance companies are willing to cover/pay a lot. 

On Insurance Companies: Believes that "big commercial [insurers] have to respect the contract," implying that well-documented appeals can be successful. 

Potential Alternate Use Case: Suggested that a similar AI tool could be valuable for appealing property tax assessments, which have become a major issue in his neighborhood Peachtree City. 

Estimated thousands of appeals on property taxes since the city keeps raising their property value 

Warned that this feature is good for the current state of the economy, but could be cyclical, such that house prices could go down again. 

Analysis & Summary 

1. Problems, Needs, or Motivations Uncovered: 

Problem 1: Administrative Burden & Time Consumption. The core problem we identified is confirmed, but with a critical nuance. The most time-consuming part wasn't just the appeal to the insurer; it was the preliminary fight with the hospital to get accurate billing information. The need is for a solution that streamlines the entire dispute lifecycle, not just the insurance appeal letter. 

Problem 2: Emotional Drain and Depersonalization. The participant vividly described feeling like "a number." This highlights a deep-seated need for empowerment and advocacy. Customers don't just want a tool; they want a "champion" that fights for them on an equal footing with large, impersonal corporations. 

Problem 3: Asymmetric Information and Intimidation. The participant succeeded because he was persistent, knew to ask for an itemized bill, and was able to articulate precise questions due to working in the insurance industry. This is a barrier for most. The need is for a service that demystifies the process and translates complex medical bills and denial reasons into clear, actionable "questions." 

2. Evidence/Examples to Support Claims: 

Quote on Time/Depersonalization: "You become a number, you get to where you are in the pile... They are not in a hurry." This story perfectly illustrates the power imbalance and the consumer's feeling of helplessness against bureaucratic delays. 

Story of Success Through Persistence: The bill reduction from $18,000 to $280 is a powerful story. It proves that appeals work, but it also shows the multi-step process: 1) Challenge the hospital's bill, 2) Engage the insurer with precise questions. His method is the blueprint for what our AI should automate. 

Pattern of Informal Process: The fact that no formal form was needed—just a clear, written list of questions—is significant. It suggests that the barrier is not always complex paperwork but rather the clarity and precision of the argument, which is an ideal task for AI. 

3. Implications for the Problem and Opportunity: 

Reshapes the ICP Slightly: While our ICP focuses on the 40-50s "sandwich generation," this 63-year-old managing his mother's care is a perfect example of the expanded "caregiver" segment. His motivations (lack of time, need for advocacy) align perfectly with our ICP. This validates that our target is broadened to include anyone managing complex care for a family member, not just a specific age band. 

Expands the Product Scope (MVP+): The interview suggests our initial MVP (handling the insurance appeal) is correct. However, for long-term success, we must consider features that help users first decode and dispute inaccurate hospital bills. The biggest "win" in this story was correcting the hospital's errors before even engaging the insurer. This is a major product insight. 

Strengthens Our Value Proposition: The participant’s comment that the product "will help because can write the questions" directly validates our core hypothesis. It confirms that the confusion is a major barrier and that an AI that can generate clear, evidence-based inquiries is a compelling solution. 

Highlights the Emotional Angle for Marketing: The feeling of being a "number" is a powerful emotional hook. Our messaging should not just be about saving money or time, but about restoring dignity, control, and personal advocacy. We are not just an app; we are the customer's "agent" against faceless corporations. 

Conclusion: This interview strongly validates the problem space and the core solution. It also provides crucial nuance: the enemy is not just the insurance denial, but the entire opaque and time-consuming healthcare billing system. Our AI agent must be positioned as a comprehensive advocate that guides the user from the first surprising bill to the final, successful appeal. 

Interviewee: 50 year old male, CEO at Serenity MSO, a mental health clinic with an advocacy office that assists patients with appealing denials with no extra charge. All providers in the clinic are out-of-network. 

1.   Can you briefly explain Serenity’s role in supporting patients with claims management? 

If a patient is denied by their health insurance, Serenity will assist the patient by handling the entirety of the appeal process without charge. Since the patient coming to the mental health clinic is often mentally ill, Serenity will only give the patient the responsibility of signing documents when needed. The patient is informed of the entire process and is asked for approval for decisions. 

2. What documents or specific forms do you usually see gathered in the appeals process? 

The insurance policy, which is notoriously difficult to find and decipher. Insurance policies are usually not on the web (insurance policies are specific person to person) 

3. What types of medical services or specialties tend to generate the highest number of denials in your experience? 

This question is not relevant for this company since Serenity MSO only provides 2 treatments (KMS and Ketamine). If there is a denial, it is one of the two. 

4. In your work, do you typically deal more with in-network or out-of-network denials, and how does the strategy differ? 

Only out-of-network because all of the providers are out-of-network. 

7. How important are filing deadlines in the appeals process, and which deadlines cause the most challenges? 

Each policy dictates how much time you must appeal. Time isn’t much of an issue currently since ChatGPT can help decipher the policy. It can take 60-90 days for the insurance company to respond to the appeal. If they deny the appeal, they would have go through another layer of appeals. 

8. How does your process differ for appealing denials from major insurers like UnitedHealthcare, Anthem, Aetna, or Cigna? 

Because Serenity only has 2 niche treatments, the denial process for each case is similiar enough to each other so that it is less difficult to appeal. This case is 		 
specific to Serenity since most providers are not like this. In network appeals from major insurers often place the stress of underpaying on the healthcare provider, 	who can choose to either pay an attorney to get money back or transfer the burden to the patient. 

9. On the patient’s end, what do they need to pay after an appeal is denied? 

Serenity does not charge the patient for helping them appeal because their high fees are high enough to absorve the cost of drafting an appeal.  

10. Do you partner with outside law firms? If so, what type of firms or specialties do you look for (e.g., healthcare law, insurance litigation, ERISA expertise)? 

- Yes, Serenity uses an exclusive attorney for handling out-of-network claims. When drafting an appeal, the insurance policy is acquired. If the advocacy office does not understand it, they push it through ChatGPT, hire an attorney ($1500 per hour) to determine case 

11. On average, what is the approximate total value of denied claims you typically see? 

The value is often over $100,000, but this doesn’t apply to most places since these appeals are out-of-network. This case is similar to that of a cancer patient doing 	chemo often. 

13. On average, can you give me an estimate of the percentage of denied claims that Serenity handles end up being overturned? 

Nearly 100% because they choose to fight the battles they think they’re going to win. Reza described nailing the policy as threading 100 needles at the right time. Because Serenity knows the process, if they know a patient is going to qualify for a legal remedy, then they go down the path with them. They don’t send appeals that they  know they’re going to lose. Writing appeals is dependent on rights the patient has written in the policy 

There are many level of appeals: they take the case to an insurance regulator. The problem is that even if laws that do have “teeth”, regulators do not enforce them. 

14. Is there a pattern that you see in who needs the most support for denial/appeals? 

The insurance company denies the claim for a “bullshit” reason regarding prior authorization (they had authorization), were underpaid, ineligible health 	documentation (ONLY for out of network because there’s no contract between 
provider and insurance company).  

For in-network basis, there’s an actual contract between provider and insurance company and a policy between patient and insurance company.  

15. What is the one thing you would change about the process itself? 

The most challenging part is educating the patient because they do not know that they have rights. They are often not accustomed to the doctor’s office having an advocacy office. People will attempt to coerce patients to switch to in-network, but advice is often given that insurance companies are not allowed to force you to switch. Most often, the patient doesn't know policy exists. Furthermore, the health insurance policy is hard to find and decipher. 

Another big challenge is understanding policy: requires very expensive attorney  For Serenity, it is easier to handle out-of-network claims because they only do 2 services, so it is easier to narrow down). If Serenity asked their current attorney to help a cancer patient appeal, the attorney probably will not be able to help. There is a lot of convoluted if-else's so it would be impossible to summarize in a page.  

16. How much exposure do you currently have to AI in your operations, and in what areas do you see it being most useful? 

ChatGPT is currently used for reading through insurance policy quicker.  

17. If an AI-driven denial solution were presented, what would be your biggest concern (accuracy, compliance, cost, or patient/provider trust)? 

1. Accuracy 

2. HIPPA 

3. Serenity do not want their info to be used to make a model for other people (“our 	stuff is proprietary”) 

Reza’s Take on the In-Network Provider 

The doctor has a contract with the insurance company where they agree to a reduced rate and, in exchange, will abide by insurance company guidelines 

Contracts are all encompassing, meaning the doctor has very little rights after signing with the healthcare provider. 

If an insurance company does not pay the entirety of the bill (if at all), it is because of 2 common reasons: 

 	1. the doctor submitted wrong documentation or didn’t follow specific 	guidelines 

2. The insurance company is fucking the doctor:  

Let's say a doctor is supposed to receive $250 from office visit (contracted rate), but only received reimbursement of $235. If the doctor hired someone to fight against the claim, it would cost as much or more money to get that relatively small difference back. This is why insurance companies get away with shortchanging providers. 

Patient: They must pay the in-network cost share, BUT if they get denied: 

Some doctors are going to fight against the insurance company 

Some doctors lack resources because it is expensive to hire lawyers, so they may require the patient to pay the amount that the insurance company shortchanges them. 

If the patient is smart and understands the insurance policy, they would not pay the bill that the provider gives them and force the clash between the provider and insurance company.  

If the patient did something wrong like not paying their premium, then the fault is on the patient 

 

Vast Denial Gap Slide:  

Our initial hypothesis was simple: the appeals process is confusing and time-consuming, so nobody ever fights the denials. Our interviews validated this and revealed that if we removed those barriers, more people would appeal. 

Who we talked to Slide: 

We talked to 15 customers, but these 5 stories surprised us the most. 4 are patients or caregivers, and 1 is an industry expert. Originally, we thought our ideal customer was between the ages of 40 and 50, but, as you can see, their ages range from 24 to 63. This indicates a wider market segment that we identify as the “sandwich generation”—individuals who are responsible for caring for others in addition to themselves. 

Through these stories, we uncovered four key insights: 

Key Insight #1 Slide:  

First: The process is an overwhelming maze. 

People get buried under a mountain of documents—Explanation of Benefits, changing bills, and confusing chains of communications coming from different sources.  

We also learned from Andy and Mike that most of the grunt work comes from emailing the right people like claims adjusters and union representatives. 

Many people also don’t have the right mindset. We learned that Jen was different because she worked at a medical clinic and learned to never take the bills at face value. 

Key Insight #2 Slide: 

Second: Winning requires knowledge many people overlook. 

The system is built on a power imbalance.  

During our interview with Reza, the CEO of a mental health clinic, he bet me any amount of money that most adults couldn’t locate their insurance policy if asked. He added that even if they could, the policy would likely be hundreds of pages long and written in language only an attorney could interpret. 

Andy only won his appeal because he knew about the ‘Coverage-Until-26’ rule and Mike successfully saved ten thousand dollars just knowing to ask the hospital for the itemized bill.  

Key Insight #3 Slide: 

Third: Most people simply give up because the potential cost of fighting, with a lawyer often outweigh paying the bill. 

"It didn't make sense to go through a more intense appeal process and involve lawyers because I would have spent more." - 40 year old woman 

“It would cost as much or more money to get that relatively small difference back. This is why insurance companies get away with shortchanging providers.” - insurance industry expert. 

Key Insight #4 Slide: 

And finally, the most important insight: Trust 

This isn’t just about a smart algorithm. Andy told us he just wanted human empathy from the process. He still wants someone to say “i’m sorry you had to go through this”. Jen said she’d only use an AI app if it had strong ‘guardrails,’ giving her full control to review and approve every action. 

Core Opportunity Slide: 

Through our customer discovery, we learned it’s not just about filling out template appeal forms, but many can get through the process with only emails for in-network policies. Also, we can’t just build a smart bot. We have to build a secure, empathetic, transparent, and educational assistant.
